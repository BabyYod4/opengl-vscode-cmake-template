# Barebone OpenGL VScode workspace using CMAKE in windows 10

Like the name suggests this VsCode workspace can be used to run `OpenGL` with `GLEW` and `GLFW` in both debug mode or normal mode. 
Debug mode is accessed by pressing `f5` and nomal mode by pressing `ctrl+d`. Be sure to change the keyboard shortcuts just in case. 

You need to also create a `bin` and `build` folder for CMAKE to put its shit in it. 

There is no reason this cannot be used in Linux, but please make sure that the required steps on installing OpenGL 3+ are done on your Linux PC. 

In windows you need to download MinGW32 and set it to your path if you dont want to be stuck with the decrepit excuse of an compiler MSVC is. 

Hope you'll enjoy!
